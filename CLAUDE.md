# HunterSim — working agreement

A from-scratch clone of cifi-tools.com's hunter simulator/optimizer for the game CIFI, built by
extracting the real game math (the actual `release.wasm` evaluator, the real upgrade cost
curves, the real save format) rather than approximating it.

Read this before changing anything. It exists so you don't have to guess where things live or
re-derive decisions that were already made and validated.

---

## Non-negotiable principles

These are the standard every change is held to. They are listed first because they are the
point, not decoration.

1. **Explicit over implicit.** No silent defaults, no `|| {}` papering over a missing field, no
   "it probably works". If a required input is absent, throw with a message naming the field.
2. **Deterministic.** The same input produces the same output, every time. The optimizer
   contains no `Math.random`. The evaluator is bit-reproducible. Anything that breaks
   reproducibility is a bug, not a tradeoff.
3. **One canonical method per concern.** If two places do the same job, one of them is wrong.
   Consolidate rather than sync. See the inventory below — everything has exactly one home.
4. **Schema-enforced and validated.** Shapes are declared once, derived everywhere, and checked
   by invariants that run automatically. See `webapp/public/storeSchema.js`.
5. **Validate, never assume.** Do not claim a fix works because it looks right. Run the gate.
   Compare against the original tool. If you assert a cause, prove it — and if you can't, say
   so plainly instead of guessing. (A prior explanation in this repo blamed a missing "Anchor
   40" for a score gap; decoding the build showed Anchor *was* present. Don't do that.)
6. **No legacy paths, no fallbacks.** Either it works or it fails loudly. Dead code gets
   deleted, not commented out or left "just in case". Git history is the archive.
7. **Comments explain WHY, especially for non-obvious decisions.** This codebase's comments
   carry hard-won empirical findings. Preserve that. When you remove a workaround, say what it
   was compensating for.

### Project history you need to know

This codebase went through a long stretch of AI-assisted development where fixes were layered
on fixes without cleanup — patches compensating for earlier patches, several parallel
implementations of the same logic, and "fixed" claims that weren't verified. Much of that has
been cleaned up (see the git log), but **assume nothing is correct because it looks
intentional**. If you find something odd, verify it against the original tool before preserving
or "fixing" it.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `webapp/public/` | The shipped app. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, **no build step**, loaded via `<script>` tags in dependency order. |
| `webapp/server.js` | Tiny static file server with dev live-reload (`LIVE_RELOAD=0` disables). |
| `webapp/public/optimizer/` | The build optimizer — see below. |
| `tools/bench/` | The optimizer acceptance gate and schema tests. Runs under Node against the **shipped** browser files. |
| `compare-mcp/` | MCP server + fixtures for comparing the clone against the live cifi-tools.com site. |
| `bridge/` | `cifi-bridge`, published to npm separately: pulls a save off an Android device over ADB. |

Run it: `node webapp/server.js` → http://localhost:5173

## The canonical-method inventory

There is exactly one place for each of these. **Do not add a second.**

| Concern | Canonical home |
|---|---|
| Simulation / param resolution | `webapp/public/hunterSimBrowser.js` (`HunterSim`) |
| Game data (talents, attributes, costs, deps, caps) | `webapp/public/hunterDefs.js` (`HUNTER_DEFS`) |
| Allocation legality + enumeration + moves | `webapp/public/optimizer/space.js` (`AllocSpace`) |
| Search algorithm | `webapp/public/optimizer/search.js` (`HunterOptimizer`) |
| Optimizer parallelism (browser only) | `webapp/public/optimizer/runner.js` + `worker.js` |
| Persisted store shape + invariants | `webapp/public/storeSchema.js` (`StoreSchema`) |
| Evaluation state for a build | `app.js` → `evalStateFor(build, iterations)` |
| Optimizer config for a build | `app.js` → `cfgFor(hunter, build)` |
| Purchase-path config | `app.js` → `statPathCfgFor(hunter, baseline)` |
| Purchase-path walk (stats/inscriptions) | `hunterStatPathBrowser.js` → `greedyPurchasePath()` |
| Coarse evaluation fidelity | `HunterOptimizer.SCREEN_ITERATIONS` (one value, shared) |
| Full evaluation fidelity | `HunterOptimizer.FINAL_ITERATIONS` |
| Build share-code encode/decode | `webapp/public/buildCode.js` |
| Optimizer acceptance gate | `tools/bench/run.js` |
| Store schema tests | `tools/bench/schema-test.js` |
| Clone-vs-live comparison | `compare-mcp/batch-test.mjs` |

**Three config builders exist and that is correct** — they feed three different APIs:
`evalStateFor` → `HunterSim.evaluate` (`overrides`/`upgrades`); `cfgFor` →
`HunterSim.compileEvaluator` (`baseOverrides`/`globalUpgrades` + node tables + budgets);
`statPathCfgFor` → `greedyPurchasePath` (talents/attributes pinned instead of varied). They must
describe the same account state. **If you add an account-state field to one, add it to all
three in the same change.**

## Validated invariants

These are established facts, verified by direct experiment. Don't re-litigate them; if you
think one is wrong, disprove it with a test.

- **The evaluator is exactly deterministic.** A fresh WASM instance returns bit-identical output
  for identical arguments. Verified directly.
- **Determinism requires a fresh instance per call.** The RNG state lives in mutable wasm
  globals. Reusing an instance drifts (~0.05%); restoring linear memory alone leaves the
  instance in a state that *aborts* on the next call. Both verified — see
  `tools/bench/resetprobe.js`.
- **Because of that, memoization by (allocation, iterations) is exact and sound.** The optimizer
  relies on this; it typically halves real evaluation count.
- **Sampling the same allocation repeatedly is pointless.** Any code averaging N evaluations of
  one allocation is averaging N identical numbers. To reduce error, raise `iterations`.
- **100-iteration scores are a ranking surrogate, not a verdict.** ~0.9% mean deviation from
  1000-iteration scores, ~1.2% pairwise rank inversions. Fine for narrowing candidates, not for
  choosing the winner — which is why the search decides at `FINAL_ITERATIONS`.
- **Evaluation cost scales with how far a build progresses**, not just iteration count (~11ms at
  level 12, ~60ms at level 79, both at 100 iterations).
- **A share code does not fully determine a loot score.** Run
  `node tools/bench/params-report.js <hunter>` for the gap: Knox reads 91 sim params and its
  code carries 46. A code-only evaluation can legitimately land *below* a score recorded on a
  real account; it can never legitimately land *above* one.
- **`upgrades.gems_nodes.attraction_lootKnox` reaches the wasm but changes the returned loot
  score by exactly nothing** (arg 0 vs 150 → bit-identical). Don't chase it as a cause.
- **Legality is a state predicate, not a path predicate.** A node at level > 0 is legal iff it's
  within `maxLevel`, every dependency parent is > 0, and any `minValue` tier threshold is met by
  points spent in strictly-lower-threshold nodes. Order of purchase never matters. This is what
  makes exhaustive support enumeration valid.

---

## How the optimizer works

The structural insight: attribute trees have only **361 / 289 / 145** dependency-closed subsets
(Borge / Ozzy / Knox — measured, not estimated). Small enough to enumerate exhaustively, so no
heuristic ever guesses which part of the tree to fund.

1. **Enumerate** every dependency-closed, affordable support set (which nodes get funded at all).
2. **Screen** each at a canonical fill.
3. **Survey** the strongest with a coarse coordinate exchange, then **refine** the survivors to a
   fixpoint: on exit, no transfer of 8/4/2/1 points between any pair of nodes improves the score.
4. **Decide** among finalists at full fidelity — the same measurement the build card displays.

The user's current build competes as a finalist on identical terms, which is why the optimizer
cannot return a downgrade. Allocations leaving more than one point idle are never evaluated
(respeccing to spend them is essentially always better).

**What "evaluate every combination" honestly means:** the full space cannot be enumerated (two
attributes per hunter are uncapped). The *structural* choice is exhaustive; the *depth* choice is
a coordinate-exchange fixpoint. Say it that way — don't claim more.

### Things the optimizer deliberately does NOT do any more
Removed because each was compensating for the previous one: random-mutation beam search, greedy
marginal seeding, epsilon exploration, stagnation restarts, multi-restart passes, a bespoke
"chain-unlock" move, a final `repairLegality` pass, and localStorage history seeding. **Do not
reintroduce any of them.** An unlock chain is just another enumerated support set. Legality is
guaranteed by construction and asserted at the end, not repaired.

---

## Validation — run these

```bash
node tools/bench/schema-test.js        # store schema invariants (fast, run always)
node tools/bench/run.js                # optimizer gate: every known build, stops at first failure
node tools/bench/run.js --all          # full picture
node tools/bench/run.js borge 0 10     # a slice while iterating
node tools/bench/show.js               # pretty-print the last results.json
```

The optimizer gate replays every real build code in `compare-mcp/known-builds*.mjs` (182 of
them) through two checks:

- **Parity** — clone's loot score vs the score recorded for that code. **Asymmetric on purpose:**
  clone *below* recorded is expected (account state a code can't carry); clone *above* recorded is
  a hard failure (nothing missing can inflate a score).
- **Quality** — given exactly the budget the import spent, the optimizer matches or beats it on
  *that build's own objective* (loot builds on loot/min, push builds on average stage). The other
  metric is reported as a warning, never fatal — pushing deeper genuinely costs loot/min, and
  gating both would fail a push build for succeeding.

Supporting tools: `decode.js` (what a build code actually carries), `params-report.js` (which sim
params a code can/can't carry), `capcheck.js`, `profile.js`, `ts-readiness.js`.

**Manual cross-check against the original tool** is the ultimate arbiter and is cheap: export the
build code, import it into cifi-tools.com as a guest, compare Loot Score / Ø Stage / Ø Time /
runs-per-day. Do this whenever a number is in question.

---

## Gotchas that will bite you

- **`index.html` script order matters.** No modules, no bundler — `window.X` globals are
  populated in tag order. `storeSchema.js` must load after `hunterDefs.js` and
  `optimizer/space.js`. Cross-file *calls* happen at runtime so definition order is looser, but
  don't rely on that.
- **Bump `?v=` on every changed asset in `index.html`**, and `WORKER_VERSION` in
  `optimizer/runner.js` when `optimizer/worker.js` changes. A Worker URL caches independently of
  the page; without the bump a worker silently keeps running the old code.
- **Web Workers resolve relative `fetch()` against their own directory.** `optimizer/worker.js`
  sets `HUNTERSIM_ASSET_BASE` before importing `hunterSimBrowser.js` for this reason.
- **The scoring worker pool is capped (`MAX_POOL_SIZE`).** Each worker holds its own WASM module
  and churns a fresh instance per evaluation; uncapped, high-level builds hit
  "Cannot allocate Wasm memory for new instance".
- **Never wipe localStorage or IndexedDB.** There is no backend. The store is mirrored to
  IndexedDB precisely because browsers bundle localStorage into "clear cache". Losing both is
  unrecoverable user data.
- **Don't yield with `requestAnimationFrame` in a long computation** — it's paused in a
  background tab and the work stalls entirely. Use `setTimeout(…, 0)`.

---

## Adding things

- **A store field:** one line in `SCHEMA` in `storeSchema.js`. Nothing else. Never write
  `store.x = store.x || {}` at a call site.
- **A store invariant:** a check in `validateStore()`, plus a case in
  `tools/bench/schema-test.js`.
- **Game data (a talent, an attribute, a cost):** `hunterDefs.js` only. Confirm it against the
  live site first and note in a comment how it was confirmed.
- **An optimizer change:** run the gate before and after. A change that doesn't improve the gate
  and isn't a correctness fix isn't worth the risk.

## TypeScript

Measured with `node tools/bench/ts-readiness.js`:

```
9,375 lines · 53 cross-file globals · 234 getElementById · 130 querySelector
86 innerHTML assignments · 13 JSDoc blocks
app.js (3,119) + shipsPage.js (2,317) = 58% of all code
```

**Assessment: a full `.ts` conversion is not currently worth it; JSDoc + `checkJs` is.**

The blocker isn't the logic — `optimizer/`, `storeSchema.js`, `hunterSimBrowser.js`,
`costFormulas.js` and `buildCode.js` are pure, well-bounded modules that would convert almost
mechanically (~2,000 lines, low risk, real payoff). The cost is concentrated in the two big
DOM files: 364 untyped element lookups each needing narrowing, 86 `innerHTML` string templates a
type checker can't see into, and 53 `window.*` globals that would need a declared global surface.
A full conversion also introduces a **build step**, which this project deliberately does not have
— that's a real property worth keeping, not an accident.

**Step 1 is already done** — `jsconfig.json` + `types/globals.d.ts` are in the repo, declaring
the core module contracts (`AllocSpace`, `HunterOptimizer`, `HunterSim`, `StoreSchema`,
`HUNTER_DEFS`, build codes, purchase paths) as both bare identifiers and `window.*` properties.
Zero runtime change, no build step.

```bash
npm install     # typescript is the only devDependency
npm run check   # tsc --noEmit -p jsconfig.json
```

**Current state: 38 errors across 8 files. This is NOT clean yet — do not assume it is.**

| Kind | Count | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| TS2339 property-does-not-exist | 18 | Modules whose IIFE takes `(window ?? globalThis)`; the `globalThis` branch has no declared properties. Fix with a JSDoc `@param` on the IIFE. |
| TS2322 / TS18047 null inference | 8 | The `let cached = null; … cached = realValue` lazy-init pattern. Fix with a JSDoc `@type`. |
| TS2349 not-callable | 4 | `wasmExports[name](...)` — the DOM lib types wasm exports as `ExportValue`. Needs a cast. |
| TS18048 possibly-undefined | 3 | `EvalResult.mat1/2/3` are genuinely optional; `incomeModel.js` assumes present. **Real finding** — worth a guard. |
| other | 5 | Inference artifacts around default parameters and `Array.from` element types. |

Almost all of it is annotation debt in untyped JS rather than defects, but the checker already
earned its keep: it found that `optimizer/worker.js` could invoke a null `evalFast` if a batch
ever arrived before init (now an explicit throw), and that `incomeModel.js` reads optional
fields unguarded.

**Remaining path:**

2. Drive `npm run check` to zero by adding JSDoc `@type`/`@param` annotations to the pure
   modules. Start with `storeSchema.js` (the shape is already declared, so the types nearly
   write themselves) and `optimizer/space.js`. Then add each newly-clean file to
   `jsconfig.json`'s `include`.
3. Only if that proves insufficient, convert the pure modules to real `.ts` with `esbuild`
   emitting into `webapp/public/`, leaving the DOM files as checked JS.

**Do not attempt a full `.ts` conversion of `app.js`/`shipsPage.js` as a first move.** They are
58% of the code, carry 364 untyped element lookups and 86 `innerHTML` templates, and converting
them forces a build step this project deliberately does not have. The payoff-to-risk ratio is
far worse than steps 2 and 3.
